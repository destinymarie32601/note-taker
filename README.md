# Note Taker

## Description
This is a note taker app that had starter code for the front end, and my job was to develop and connect the back end using Express.js. The user is able to write new notes and save and retrieve them from a Json file. When the user clicks on their saved notes in the left hand column, they will see their previously written notes back in the main right column. This application solves the need to manually write notes on a piece of paper, and allows a convenient and organized location to find all of their previous notes. Throughout this project, I furthered my knowledge and ability to create and connect the backend to front end applications. This project is deployed through Heroku.

## Usage
This project uses backend Express.js to allow the user to easily write and save notes to the application. When the application is run, the user is able to click the " + " symbol to write a title, and text of a new note. When the user wants to save the note, they can click the save icon, and find their note on the left column. The user can click any previously saved note on the left column and their title and text will reappear on the main note input section. To start this application, type "npm-start" in the terminal.
